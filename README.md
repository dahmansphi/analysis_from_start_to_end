## The Content

This is the second element of **the Big Bang of Data Science**, **`Analysis from the Start to The End`**.  
I don’t want to stick to that _abstract and direct_ definition from the academic book, on the meaning of analysis, but from the industrial one. So, I believe **ANALYSIS** is the _co-concertmaster_ that sits in the second chair of the highest leadership position among all the other parts that are responsible for the outcome of a product. 
Analysis is an art that has the characteristics of being a two-edged sword. In other words, if your understanding of analysis is based on **subjective, rigid ground** then your answers/solutions/products are for sure **questioned**. However, if your analysis is based on **objective, scientific grounds** then your answers/solutions/products are for sure **worthy of consuming**. If you search any search engine the word of analysis, you should not be surprised with the astronomical number of results on your search. The problem with many of the materials which discuss the subject of analysis is that **two perspectives are there**: 

> the first, the perspective of analysis as a bunch of graphs and tables, 
> and the second, the perspective of analysis is a bunch of tests and tools that applies them. 

Well, one can argue there is nothing wrong with that, but the problem arises when one fails to understand the raw materials that are needed to present those tables and figures, in addition, the fundamentals of those tools and tests that produce them. To this end, **this book aims to address this mis conceptual understanding about analysis**; basically, the book materials are constructed in such way that one can:
 
> firstly, understand the important of data that come from solid research, 
> secondly, to understand the fundamentals of analysis from philosophical and scientifical perspective, 
> thirdly, complete grasp on the meaning of hypothesis, as forming, articulating, etc., 
> and finally, the comprehensive knowledge on the tests and tools are there to help you implement your analysis. 

To this end, **the second book** is carefully crafted to meet all the requirements to build your product on the right foundation of analysis. Here is a quick view of the content of the book.

# Book competitive advantage

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> 1. In this book you will find **a few outlines** that deliver competitive advantages.  
as outlined above in the introduction, this book is **the second book** from **The Big Bang of Data Science** that means it’s an element among other elements of a project. This implies that the outlines and the contents are not ONLY discussed from an analysis perspective, but also from a wider perspective of the entire project. This offers you an opportunity to excel in the subject of analysis from a wider range of disciplines.  . 
> 2. As I have outlined above in the introduction, so many materials discuss the subject of analysis, however, many of which fail to focus on the subject of **orientation**. If your analysis is **subjective oriented**, i.e., your analysis is controlled by external factors such as your background, education, environment, culture and many more, then your final solution is questionable. However, if your analysis is **objective oriented**, i.e., your analysis is based on methodical, and scientific facts, then your final product is worthy of consuming. This material is constructed based on the latter, that is **objective oriented** approach.  
> 3. The slogan of the **Big Bang of Data Science** is **From academia to industry**, this material is obligated to that. You will have two types of labs: the first is using synthetical type of data to implement the abstracts and theories you learn, and the second uses a real dataset that we have built from **the first book Research from the Start to the End**. As a result, you will master the idea from abstract to applied.
> 4. Lastly, all the types of tests we are going to learn about will be executed using an open-source statistical tool, that is **Jamovi**. This tool offers several statistical tests that one needs to do research analysis. Notably, unlike other material that presents **analysis** within the framework of jamovi, this material coaches you how to understand the selection of the right test, first, then you can use this tool or any other tool of your choice to execute the test. So, this perceptive gives you confidence in relying on many other tools of your choice if you understand each test independently.
